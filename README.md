# Optimization-Based-Control-and-Estimation-in-Compliant-Robotic-Systems-
Course Project:

From the project on optimization-based control and estimation in compliant robotic systems, several key learnings can be distilled:

The utility of framing control and state estimation as constrained optimization problems, especially in the context of a compliant end-effector which presents unique challenges due to its coupling of forces and system configuration.

The development of a self-supervised data collection method that enhances efficiency by eliminating the need for extra displacement sensors and human supervision.

The practical application of the method in a real-world task, specifically a block tilting task using a vacuum suction cup, which highlighted the responsiveness and accuracy of the approach with a computation time of less than 20ms per timestep.

The project's comprehensive approach, from system identification to state estimation and control, showcases the integration of theoretical concepts with practical, hands-on robotic manipulation tasks.
